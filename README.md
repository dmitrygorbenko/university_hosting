# university_hosting

I made this hosting software to maintain hosting service un my university's network.

It was 2005 and I managed to install it under domain name 'hosting.ai'.

Anyone was able to setup his own PHP-based hosting on my servers for free.

Actually, I tried to copy https://mirohost.net/ by that time, and I did it.
